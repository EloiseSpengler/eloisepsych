title: About me
---
I am a counselling psychologist registered with the HPCSA (PS) who believes that people’s inherent resilience toward well-being and growth in times of immense pain and difficulty is remarkable.

I am dedicated to assisting individuals to discover their passion and thrive in their various challenging environments. My focus is on promoting my client’s well-being whilst respecting where they are in their process of healing and discovery.

I enjoy working with people from all walks and phases of life with whatever their needs are. I particularly enjoy working with individuals dealing with grief and loss, and those who have experienced trauma or severe life stressors. Additionally, I am interested in issues around identity development and personal growth. I furthermore aid individuals struggling with the anxiety of everyday life and the stress management it entails.
